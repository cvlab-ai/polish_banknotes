# *FutureAppName*

*FutureAppName* is an Open Source mobile app, which goal is to help visually handicapped people live the life we all do. By detecting our local currency's denomination (PLN - Polish zloty) using neural networks, it allows a user to know what banknote they're holding. The application provides support on a daily basis, such as going shopping, using ATMs, buying tickets or visiting restaurants.

## About technologies
### Mobile app
We're developing two versions of this application - one for Android and one for iOS. Both of them are written natively using corresponding technologies - Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS. Currently, supported system versions are:
* iOS 11.0+ (iPhone 5s+)
* Android #TODO

### Neural network
The neural network we're working on is based on TensorFlow+Keras Image classification.

### Datasets
We're using datasets created by previous teams working on this subject (information about those are given in *Acknowledgments* section). About numbers, we currently have around 3500-4800 images per denomination, mostly in good quality with 0 or 1 banknote at it.
