# Using the latest APK with the latest model for AI devs.
**To use the latest model with the latest APK you should:**
1. Download the latest APK (which will be upgraded and notified when released).
2. Install it on your android device.
3. If there is no folder ```Android/data/pg.eti.project.polishbanknotes/``` then run the app. The folder should pop up. 
4. Go to ```Android/data/pg.eti.project.polishbanknotes/files/MlModelsFolder/``` and put the latest model in this directory with exactly this name (very important): ```latest_model.tflite```.
5. Open the app and when you drag bottom sheet up, you should see an information about using your latest model. Enjoy!
